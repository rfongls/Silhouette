      Produce **two files** using the file fence convention:
      1) file: app/main.py -> Program that imports silhouette_core.skills.http_get_json.wrapper.tool and prints the length of the JSON keys from https://httpbin.org/json
      2) file: tests/test_app.py -> pytest test that asserts program import works.
      Use code fences with exact file paths.
    expect_files:
      - app/main.py
      - tests/test_app.py
    commands:
      - python -m pip install -q pytest==8.* requests==2.*
      - pytest -q
