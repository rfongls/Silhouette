# Repo Cleanup Report

The following unneeded files and directories were removed:

- `__pycache__/` compiled artifacts across the repo
- stale `logs/.keep` placeholder
- old `src/` scaffolding and related README files
- unused export keys under `exports/`
- outdated compiled test artifacts

All core code, docs, and training scripts remain intact.
