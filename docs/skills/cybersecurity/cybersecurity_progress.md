## Risks / Notes
- **Legal/Authorization:** never execute active modules without written authorization + verified scope.
- **Privacy:** redact PII; minimize retention; purge policy must exist before wide deployment.
- **Safety:** throttle & deny-lists default-on; global kill-switch verified.
- **Offline-first:** all scanners/tools must work without internet; caches (CVE, KEV, controls) seeded locally; online sync is optional.
- **Simulation Safety:** tabletop exercises must run in isolated labs with sanitized datasets.
