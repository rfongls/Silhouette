# Phase 10 Completion

Phase 10 concludes the initial roadmap for Silhouette Core. The project now
ships with:

- A documented release playbook and CI workflow attaching provenance artifacts.
- Customer license issuance tooling that embeds identifiers into `WATERMARK.json`.

All milestones from PR-1 through PR-27 are complete. Silhouette Core is ready
for governed distribution and future expansion.
