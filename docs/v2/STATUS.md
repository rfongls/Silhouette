## Phase 0 ‚Äî Skeleton

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
**Implemented:** 2025-10-08T00:00:00Z
**Scope:**
- Contracts for adapters, operators, router, and sinks
- Pipeline spec validation (`/api/engine/pipelines/validate`)
- Insights DB + summary endpoint (`/api/insights/summary`)
- Feature-flagged UI entry ‚ÄúEngine (Beta)‚Äù with Insights table
- Registry diagnostics endpoint (`/api/engine/registry`)

**Notes:**
- Registry is guaranteed via `engine.plugins` side-effect import.
- Minimal built-ins: `sequence` adapter, `echo` operator, `memory` sink.
- Validation rejects unknown adapters/operators/sinks with a 400 response to match docs.

## Phase 0.5 ‚Äî Demo Runs

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
**Implemented:** 2025-10-08T00:00:00Z
**Scope:**
- Execute a pipeline on demand (`POST /api/engine/pipelines/run`)
- Optional persistence into insights store
- UI button ‚ÄúRun demo pipeline‚Äù to exercise end-to-end loop

**Notes:**
- Keeps run history visible in Insights without background workers.
- `/api/engine/health` reports version `phase0.5` to align with the demo run capability.

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Adapters & Operators

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
**Implemented:** 2025-10-09T00:00:00Z
**Scope:**
- `validate-hl7` now bridges the V1 validator, returning structured `Issue`s (`validate.ok`, `validate.segment.missing`, `validate.structural`, etc.) and respecting `strict` severity promotion.
- `deidentify` wraps the V1 HL7 rules with selector/action mappings, honours `mode: copy|inplace`, and annotates metadata (`meta.deidentified`, `meta.actions`, `meta.deidentify_mode`).
- `mllp` adapter implements a TCP client that reads `<VT>‚Ä¶<FS><CR>` frames and emits `Message(id="mllp-{n}")` with connection metadata.
- Example pipelines added under `examples/engine/phase1.*` and `static/examples/engine/phase1.*`.

**Notes:**
- Config field names stay aligned with V1 to ease migration (`profile`, `strict`, selector syntax like `PID-5.1`, `mode`).
- Tests: `tests/test_op_validate_hl7_e2e.py`, `tests/test_op_deidentify_e2e.py`, `tests/test_adapter_mllp_basic.py`.
- `/api/engine/health` now reports version `phase1` to reflect the completed operator/adapter work.

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Engine UI

**Status:** üöß In progress
**Implemented:** 2025-10-12T00:00:00Z
**Scope:**
- Added `pipelines` table + SQLAlchemy model with CRUD helpers and uniqueness guard on name.
- API endpoints for list/get/save/delete stored pipelines plus `/pipelines/{id}/run` for dry vs. persisted runs.
- Engine (Beta) UI lists stored pipelines, provides a YAML editor with live validation, and wires run buttons to Insights refresh.
- Phase 2B polish: toast notifications, YAML diff preview, sync name helper, and Insights run chart.

**Notes:**
- Store auto-creates tables in dev/test if Alembic hasn't run; production should still apply migrations.
- Canvas chart is intentionally lightweight; follow-up will revisit responsiveness and accessibility.

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Background runner & replay

**Status:** üîú Planned
**Implemented:** _TBD_
**Scope:**
- Introduce the `engine_jobs` table, SQLAlchemy model, and store helpers for enqueue/lease/heartbeat/complete/fail/cancel/list/get.
- Ship `engine.runner` background worker with leasing, concurrency control, retries, exponential backoff, and dead-letter handling.
- Expand the API surface with `/api/engine/jobs` endpoints for enqueue, list/filter, inspect, cancel, and retry.
- Add replay support (adapter + API wiring) and UI hooks (Run in background button, jobs table) in Phase 3B.

**Notes:**
- Configuration toggles: `ENGINE_RUNNER_ENABLED`, `ENGINE_RUNNER_CONCURRENCY`, `ENGINE_RUNNER_LEASE_TTL_SECS`, `ENGINE_RUNNER_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS`, `ENGINE_QUEUE_MAX_QUEUED_PER_PIPELINE`.
- Testing must cover job lifecycle, retry/backoff, lease contention/expiry, cancelation semantics, replay correctness, and API edge cases (dedupe conflicts, missing pipelines).
