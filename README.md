Excellent ‚Äî I can see the full project structure in the uploaded repo.

Here‚Äôs the plan to **fix your README.md**:

* Keep **all the detailed functionality** you already had (CLI usage, directory structure, training flow, eval suites).
* Add back the **Vision / Purpose / End Goal** (based on all PRs through Phase 10).
* Update the **Project Structure** and usage details to reflect what‚Äôs actually in the repo now (`eval/`, `training/`, `scripts/`, `skills/`, etc.).
* Make sure **compliance, watermarking, licensing** from PR-17/18 are present.
* Include the **roadmap phases** summary (so README matches `phases.md`).

# üåë Silhouette Core

**Silhouette Core** is a survivable, modular, and scalable AI agent framework.  
It is purpose-aligned, hardware-flexible, and built to be **carried, revived, and evolved** across any environment ‚Äî even when modern infrastructure is unavailable.

---

## üåê Vision

Silhouette Core is a **general, self-hostable agent system**. It is designed to:

Language runtimes (Python, Java, .NET, Android, Web, C++) are **capability modules** the agent can exercise.
Silhouette Core itself is **not an app** ‚Äî it is the engine that demonstrates how agents can persist, replicate, and evolve safely.

* Operate offline or in constrained environments.  
* Learn and refine skills across multiple ecosystems (Python, Java, .NET, Android, Web, C++).  
* Support compliance and provenance (license scanning, redaction, watermarking, licensing).  
* Continuously improve itself through **training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí distillation ‚Üí redeployment**.  
* Distill large models into **small, survivable agents** that can run on the edge.  

---

## Purpose

Silhouette Core is a **general, self-hostable agent framework**. Its purpose is to:

- Operate safely in **offline or constrained environments**.  
- Support **training, distillation, and quantization** so large models can be distilled into small, task-focused agents.  
- Evaluate itself across **multiple programming ecosystems** (Python, Java, .NET, Android, Web, C++).  
- Learn continuously through a **data flywheel**: runtime evals ‚Üí traces ‚Üí training.  
- Provide **skills** (tools, wrappers) the agent can ingest dynamically.  
- Enforce **compliance and provenance**: redaction, license scanning, watermarks, customer licensing.  

## End Goal

The end state (Phase 10) is a **production-ready agent system** that can:

- **Generate, compile, and test** code across languages in isolated containers.  
- **Train itself** on successes via curated KD traces.  
- **Run on edge devices** via quantized exports.  
- **Provide governance** through licensing, watermarking, compliance gates.  
- Be packaged, released, and licensed as a **trustworthy, cross-language development agent**.

Silhouette Core is not ‚Äúan Android app‚Äù ‚Äî it is an **agent engine** that demonstrates how large models can be broken down into resilient, specialized modules that survive infrastructure collapse while still providing advanced capabilities.

At **Phase 10**, Silhouette Core will deliver:

* **Cross-language agent capabilities** (Python, Web, Java, .NET, Android, C++).  
* **Self-training** via runtime traces, turning passing code generations into training data.  
* **Edge-ready deployment** (quantized INT8/GGUF exports with <3s latency on CPU).  
* **Governed artifacts** (every model watermarked, licensed, and verifiable).  
* **Portable packaging** (pip + Docker) for survivable deployment in any environment.  

---

## üîç What It Does (Current Features)

* **Alignment-first agent loop**: persona DSL config (`persona.dsl`), deny rules, self-check.  
* **Memory & context**: logs interactions, replays into structured memory JSONL.  
* **Skills system**: dynamic tool registry (`skills/registry.yaml`), versioned (`name@vN`).  
* **Runtime evals**: cross-language build/test inside Docker (Java, .NET, Android).  
* **Offline-first mode**: deterministic stub generation when models are unavailable.  
* **Training adapters**: SFT + KD wrappers (student models distilled from teacher traces).  
* **Compliance**: SPDX license scan, redaction rules, configurable thresholds.  
* **Provenance**: WATERMARK.json in every artifact with repo commit + SHA256.  
* **Self-replication**: export profiles, distill knowledge, quantize models, package clones.

Would you like me to also **auto-generate a one-page ‚Äúat-a-glance roadmap graphic‚Äù** (a markdown table or ASCII flow) for the README so new readers immediately see the 10 phases?
