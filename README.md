# 🌑 Silhouette Core

**Silhouette** is a survivable, modular, and scalable AI agent—designed to persist even when modern infrastructure cannot. It is purpose-aligned, hardware-flexible, and built to be carried, revived, and evolved across any environment.

## 🌐 Vision

Silhouette Core is a **general, self-hostable agent framework**. It is designed to:

* Operate offline or in constrained environments.
* Learn and refine skills across programming ecosystems.
* Support compliance and provenance (redaction, license scanning, watermarking, licensing).
* Continuously improve itself through training and runtime evaluation.
* Distill large models into small, task-focused agents that survive on the edge.

Language runtimes (Python, Java, .NET, Android, Web, C++) are **capability modules** the agent can exercise.
Silhouette Core itself is **not an app** — it is the engine that demonstrates how agents can persist, replicate, and evolve safely.

## Purpose

Silhouette Core is a **general, self-hostable agent framework**. Its purpose is to:

- Operate safely in **offline or constrained environments**.  
- Support **training, distillation, and quantization** so large models can be distilled into small, task-focused agents.  
- Evaluate itself across **multiple programming ecosystems** (Python, Java, .NET, Android, Web, C++).  
- Learn continuously through a **data flywheel**: runtime evals → traces → training.  
- Provide **skills** (tools, wrappers) the agent can ingest dynamically.  
- Enforce **compliance and provenance**: redaction, license scanning, watermarks, customer licensing.  

## End Goal

The end state (Phase 10) is a **production-ready agent system** that can:

- **Generate, compile, and test** code across languages in isolated containers.  
- **Train itself** on successes via curated KD traces.  
- **Run on edge devices** via quantized exports.  
- **Provide governance** through licensing, watermarking, compliance gates.  
- Be packaged, released, and licensed as a **trustworthy, cross-language development agent**.

Silhouette Core is not “an Android app” — it is an **agent engine** that demonstrates how large models can be broken down into resilient, specialized modules that survive infrastructure collapse while still providing advanced capabilities.
