# 🌑 Silhouette Core

**Silhouette** is a survivable, modular, and scalable AI agent—designed to persist even when modern infrastructure cannot. It is purpose-aligned, hardware-flexible, and built to be carried, revived, and evolved across any environment.

---

## 🌐 Vision

Silhouette Core is a **general, self-hostable agent framework**. It is designed to:

* Operate offline or in constrained environments.
* Learn and refine skills across programming ecosystems.
* Support compliance and provenance (redaction, license scanning, watermarking, licensing).
* Continuously improve itself through training and runtime evaluation.
* Distill large models into small, task-focused agents that survive on the edge.

Language runtimes (Python, Java, .NET, Android, Web, C++) are **capability modules** the agent can exercise.  
Silhouette Core itself is **not an app** — it is the engine that demonstrates how agents can persist, replicate, and evolve safely.

## 🎯 Purpose

Silhouette Core’s purpose is to:

* Provide a **survivable AI agent** that functions even if infrastructure collapses.
* Enable **training, distillation, and quantization** of models into deployable agents.
* Validate itself with **cross-language containerized runtime evals**.
* Learn continuously via a **data flywheel**: runtime traces → curated datasets → training → improved student models.
* Maintain **compliance and governance** through watermarking, licensing, and redaction.

## 🛠 End Goal

By the end of the roadmap (Phase 10), Silhouette Core will:

* **Generate, compile, and test** real projects across multiple ecosystems (Python, Java, .NET, C++, Web, Android).  
* **Self-train** using curated runtime traces, improving its accuracy and safety over time.  
* **Run on edge devices** via quantized, lightweight exports.  
* **Package itself** for deployment with provenance (WATERMARK.json) and governance (customer license issuance).  
* Provide a **trustworthy, licensable development agent** that can survive, replicate, and evolve across environments.
