# These messages represent acknowledgements, queries, application management or
# clinical research events that do not directly translate into standard FHIR
# clinical resources.  Including them here with an empty resource plan
# ensures the pipeline still processes the messages (producing Device and
# Provenance) while signalling that no domain resources are generated.
