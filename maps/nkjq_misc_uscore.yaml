messageTypes:
  # Administrative, query, subscription, and application management events that do not
  # map to domain-specific FHIR resources.  These codes represent cancellations,
  # queries, responses or subscription management messages.  Handling them with
  # an empty resource plan ensures the translator still produces Device and
  # Provenance resources while signalling that no clinical resources are created.
